# JavaScriptSamples
The purpose of this project is to store source code samples that I write in the process of learning JavaScript.
## Running the samples
* Open "Developer tools" in your browser
* Open the source code file you are interested in a text editor.
* Paste the code into the console of the Developer tools and hit "Enter".
